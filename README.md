# Oxid Front Styles

The package is based on Webpack technology and is used to compile assets

## Installation

It is necessary to install the npm package by terminal
```sh
npm i --save-dev git+https://github.com/oxid94/oxid-front-styles.git
```

When installing this package, it is recommended to copy the configuration of the starter-kit
```sh
cp node_modules/oxid-front-styles/starter-kit/normal.js index.js
```

Once this file has been copied to the root of the project, it is necessary to replace each of the lines that appear below, adapting them to the corresponding project.

```sh
const generalConfig = {
    entry: {
        'main': path.resolve(__dirname, 'source/assets/scripts/main.js'),
    },
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
        publicPath: 'http://localhost:3000/dist/',
        filename: 'js/[name].js'
    },
    scss: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, '/source/assets/scss/**/*.scss'),
    },
    img: {
        from: path.join(__dirname, 'source/assets/img/'),
        to: path.join(__dirname, 'dist/img')
    },
    browsersSync: {
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 3000,
        open: false,
        server: {
            baseDir: ['./dist']
        },
        files: ['./dist/*']
    },
}
```
